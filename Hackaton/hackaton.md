The Hackaton problem needed a spit or wild wild imagine to solve.
Well logically , Ill say this race depends on stamin and endurance and i dont think they can finish it considering they are just 15 and 7 yrs old.
Firstly since im going to be using / Changing values we have to create a function with the parameters "i" and "j".
since in the problem Beck is always starting from the beginning and romeo is always placed ahead of beck to make it fair.
we first have to make sure the inputed parameter follow a rule.
Then with the "else" Statement we can start our real work.
Since the full length of our track is 6000 meteres and overall checkpoints is 1001.
Dividing the checkpoints with the track length would give us 5.99 rounded up to 6 metres which was given in the question
For the variables u see in code $Beck_15 and $Romeo_7 are multiplied by 6 signifying .how many checkpoints they have passed or metres in the tracks
To be able to move our runners in the code ,we must first create a counter for each of them in which the distance covered by beck is always x2 of romeo .
After we make them move then we are going to make an if statement ,checking the checkpoint they both met by comparing the value of Beck and romeo and checking if the value of beck divided by 6 is 0 
After that we can check who Won by comparing the values of each of them with the Track .if they met or passed the track value(6000metres)
Then we can all our function and give it the parameters we want 
NOTE: $i => Beck , $j => Romeo and $i >0 ang $j must always be greater than $i

For the second problem , Fred can Just use this code by changing the position of each of them in the function 
E.g  "RaceTraining('Position of Beck(Metres)', 'Position of Romeo(Metres)')"
This is my understanding and Solution of the Hackaton Problem.
